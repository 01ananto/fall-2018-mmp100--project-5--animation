# Project 5 — Animation
For this project, you’ll create a 3-second animation that is based on either [1] your own hand-sketched paper drawings (that you’ll scan into your computer); [2] on modified images of your own; or, [3] computer-drawn in a digital tool, such as Photoshop or Illustrator.

The source of your animation **must** be a sprite called `sprite.png`, which, in turn, **must** contain at *least* 90 frames. If you create 30 frames per second, this means your animation will last 3 seconds. Each frame in your sprite **must** be your own; no online images.

The file `sprite.png` **must not** be larger than 20MB. Use [a converter](https://www.gbmb.org/kb-to-mb) to make sure your final sprite doesn’t exceed 20MB.

You may create a choppier animation that is longer by using fewer frames per second. For example, if you chose to render 24 frames in a single second, then you’d end up with a 3.75 second animation. (Ninety frames divided by 24 frames yields 3.75 seconds.) You may also opt to create an animation of more than 90 frames.

Should you create a piece you feel is portfolio-worthy, then you should upload the project to your MMP server accounts, but this is optional.

## Directions
1. Add your name to the `title` element in the `head` section of `index.html`.
2. Add your animation’s name to the `h1` element of `index.html`.
3. Add your name to the `h2` element of `index.html`.
4. Replace the empty `sprite.png` file in the`img` folder with your sprite. **Do not** use any other image for your sprite.
5. Add your CSS to the `style.css` file in the `css` folder. **Do not** add CSS anywhere else in your project.
6. Use `#animation` in `index.html` as the container for your animation.

**Note**: *Do not* edit any file not mentioned above.

## Due Date
This is due by 3:00 PM on Saturday, 15 December 2018. **No late work will be accepted.** We’ll close the semester by watching your animations during the second half of our last class on 15 December.
